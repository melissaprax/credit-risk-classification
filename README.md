# Credit Risk Analysis Report


# Provide an overview that explains the purpose of this analysis

The purpose of this analyis was to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk using a historical lending activity dataset.

# Describe the accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the machine learning model

Look at comments inside of Credit_Risk/credit_risk_classification.ipynb for analysis on this.

# Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company.

Once there was an oversampling of data, the model responded well with high precision, accuracy and recall scores. I would recommend this model on the contigency that it is fed enough data to be fully effective. Otherwise, it could flag customers who are eligible for healthy loans and classify them as high-risk for loans.
